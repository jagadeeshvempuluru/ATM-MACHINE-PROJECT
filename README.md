# ATM Machine Project

This is a simple Java-based ATM simulation project.  
I created this project to practice core Java concepts like classes, objects, methods, and basic file handling.

The application works like a real ATM where the user can log in using an account number and PIN, and then perform operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing transaction details.

## Features

- User login with PIN
- Balance enquiry
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Transaction display
- Input validation for incorrect PIN and insufficient balance

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- OOP concepts
- Eclipse IDE

---

## Project Structure

- `src/` → contains all the Java source files  
- `.project` → Eclipse project configuration  
- `.classpath` → Java build path settings  
- `.settings/` → Eclipse IDE settings

## Why I built this project

I built this project while learning Java to understand how real-time systems like ATMs work internally.  
It helped me improve my knowledge of:

- Object-oriented programming
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- User input handling
- Project structure in Eclipse

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Eclipse
3. Run the main class
4. Follow the menu options in the console

## Future Improvements

- Connect to a database
- Add multiple user accounts
- Create a GUI version
- Add transaction history storage
